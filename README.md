# Scrapy Streaming (WIP)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aron-bordin/scrapy-streaming.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aron-bordin/scrapy-streaming)

The Scrapy Streaming provides an interface to write spiders using any programming language, using json objects to make requests, parse web contents, get data, and more.

Also, we officially provide helper libraries to develop your spiders using Java, JS, and R.
